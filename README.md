## How to Run (Console walkthrough)

> Goal: Deploy an **ALB → Target Group → Auto Scaling Group** that serves **Nginx** instances across **2 AZs** and automatically scales based on **ALB RequestCountPerTarget**.

### Prerequisites
- AWS account (N. Virginia `us-east-1` used in this guide)
- IAM permissions to create EC2/ALB/ASG resources
- (Optional) EC2 key pair if you want to SSH

## Launch template user data (Nginx)
Launch Template user data: [`scripts/user-data.sh`](scripts/user-data.sh)



### 1) Create Security Groups

**a) ALB security group – `alb-web`**
- Inbound: `HTTP (80)` from `0.0.0.0/0`
- Outbound: allow all (default)

**b) Instance security group – `web-instances`**
- Inbound: `HTTP (80)` **from security group** `alb-web` (select SG as the source, *not* a CIDR)
- Outbound: allow all (default)



> Why this setup? The goal is to make sure the traffic is only allowed from `alb-web`, which lets the internet send traffic via HTTP:80. The 'alb-web' then forwards the request to one of the instances. This instance responds back through the ALB to the user. Therefore, the idea being **User --> ALB --> EC2**

> What are the benefits of this setup? This design is very useful and popular because it gives us security, reliability, scalability, and simpler operations.

  > For example, our instances are not publicly reachable, which greatly reduces our attack surface. Additionally, we only have one entry point, so we can really harden, monitor, and rate-limit from one place. (FYI, in this project, I am basing it on port 80, but if we want to use 443 for added security, we can easily add TLS at the ALB. On top of that, we can also add WAF with ALB,  which could be done very quickly. Though note: for HTTPS:443, a domain and certificate are required.

>**Bottom Line:** This design solves multiple angles, gives us a way to enhance security, autoscale based on traffic, have a multi-AZ web tier with one public doorway, room to grow, self-healing instances while keeping the cost down and operational complexity in check!!

### 2) Create Target Group
- **Type:** *Instances*
- **Protocol/Port:** HTTP : `80`
- **VPC:** your default VPC (same as ALB/ASG)
- **Health checks:** HTTP → Path `/`
- Create now (don’t register targets yet)

> Now for the fun part. We want to make sure our instances are healthy, so we keep sending them the traffic. Imagine a scenario where you send important information, and you don't hear a reply back. That's not pleasant, right? Well, to solve this issue, we want to make sure our ALB (Application Load Balancer) will keep pinging each instance at `http://<instance>:/` if we get 200 OK enough times in a row, then the instance is deemed healthy, so our ALB can send traffic there. If it is deemed Unhealthy, then it will stop sending it there. Keep reading this post to find out how we replace the unhealthy instance.

### 3) Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- **Scheme:** Internet-facing  
- **Type:** Application
- **Network mapping:** pick **two public subnets** (two different AZs)
- **Security group:** `alb-web`
- **Listeners:** HTTP : `80` → **Forward to** the target group you created in step 2

> After it provisions, note the ALB **DNS name** (e.g., `alb-xxxx.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`).

---

### 4) Create a Launch Template
- **AMI:** Amazon Linux 2023
- **Instance type:** `t2.micro`
- **Security group:** `web-instances`
- **User data:** use this repo’s script: [`scripts/user-data.sh`](scripts/user-data.sh)  
  (copies an Nginx index with hostname & AZ)

> Leave subnet and key pair unset in the template (ASG will choose subnets).

---

### 5) Create an Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
- **Launch template:** select the one you created above
- **VPC / Subnets:** pick **two subnets** across different AZs
- **Group size:** `Desired=2`, `Min=2`, `Max=4`
- **Attach to existing target group:** choose the TG from step 2
- **Health checks:** enable **ELB** health checks
- **Instance warmup:** `60s`

**Dynamic scaling policy (Target tracking)**
- **Policy type:** Target tracking
- **Metric:** *Application Load Balancer request count per target*
- **Target value:** `60`
- **Warmup:** `60s`

Create the ASG. After a few minutes you should have **2 healthy instances** behind the ALB.

---

### 6) Generate load (optional)
On macOS:
```bash
brew install hey
export URL="http://<your-alb-dns-name>"
hey -z 3m -q 12 "$URL/"     # ~3 minutes of traffic
